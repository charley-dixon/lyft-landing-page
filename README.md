# Landing Pages

The purpose of this project initially began with wanting to recreate this Lyft landing page:
![Lyft Landing Page](./media/lyft-landing-page.png)

After getting to work, positioning, and styling everything - I realized I could turn this into a good project for my portfolio. In addition to recreating the landing page, I wanted to add a personal flair to it. I wanted to explain why I made certain decisions, and practice my scripting abilities. At an initial glance, this web page is nearly identical to the one shown above. However, take a moment to interact with the page and you will see some of the ways I was able to make this project something of my own.
